# Bakerai

## Bakerai is an online chatbot for a imaginary bakery - SAKURA. Bakerai acts as your online assistant to provide customer information they need about SAKURA without leaving the comfort of their home.

## Features implemented in Individual Project
* ###   Google translate
    Rick Feng, implemented a tanslation for all non English user input and provide translated answer for user:
    * Step 1: enable google credential to establish a connection from the bot to my server
    * Step 2: create languageDeteaction method for identifying non English input
    * Step 3: create translateThis method to translate user input from target language into English so the bot can process and predict
    * Step 4: create translateTo method to translate the prdicted answer back to target language for user to view
    * Step 5: implentment all method and embedded them into the chatbot GUI
    
    Attention!!! Uploading access key for google cloud is forbidden, Individual who wish to use this chatbot need their own google cloud that has Cloud Translation API enabled and correct access key.
  
  
    ## How did this feature improve the project?
    This feature greatly increased the potential user of this chatbot and user no longer need to translate English into their own language. Originally the chatbot called only answer in English and thus the user demographic was small. Now anyone in the worl could use it and they do not need to translate the bot's answer back and forth inside google translate.

* ###   Flickr API
    Rick Feng, implemented display the image of the product from Flickr in case the user does not know what the product looks like:
    * Step 1: enable Flickr API using keys for when bot is doing image search, it has the correct credentials
    * Step 2: take the pattern of the question in(for example user input question related to cake) and search a image that is related to the pattern
    * Step 3: take the retuen JSON file and trun it into dictionary for better manipulation
    * Step 4: generate the coorect URL for a randomly selected image from the JSON file that got reture back fomr Flickr server
    * Step 5: display the image/photo of the product in browser
  
  
    ## How did this feature improve the project?
    Sometime cunstomer has liitle to no understanding of what is product is and has no idea how they look like. This feature solve this issue since ever time user input a question, the bot is display a image related to the question in the browser. This can be expended in the future if the bakery has more items on the menu.

## previous implementation
* ###   GUI
    Elias Pinno, was tasked with implementing the GUI front end for our bot. This involved several key steps:
    * Step 1: Selecting a GUI framework within the given constraints
    * Step 2: Code framework reuse from a previous project i've worked on personally
    * Step 3: The modifcation and adoption of that code to be a workable project for the GUI
    * Step 4: Hooking up our Chat AI as an endpoint, and begin sending client inputs to the bot
    * Step 5: Final cleanup stage

    ## How did this feature improve the project?
    This feature was used to improve the interaction between users and the AI, to make talking with the AI more pleseant and more usable outside of strict command line environment. It's visually more pleasing, and opens the possiblity for further features in the future (though in the long run, this product would likely be implemented as a part of a server)

* ###   Socket communication
    Socket communication was another feature we chose to implement, done by Elias Pinno. It was unfortunately not included in the GUI, but still works as a proof of concept in client.py and server.py. You can still have conversations with the AI via a remote connection, just not via the GUI. It also involved a lot of refactoring which made the code base a lot easier to call from remote files.

    ## How did this feature improve the project?
    This feature lays the ground work for the projects actual use case, remote conversation with the AI to learn more information about our hypothetical bakery. While in the future, this is more likely to be done via web connection, having even a client server backend set up to allow this is already promising.

* ###    Sentiment Analysis
    Kanishka Verma, was tasked to implement Sentiment Analysis to improve conversation flow.
    * Step 1: I found a dataset of amazon reviews. The dataset comprised of thousands of reviews.
    * Step 2: Using Pandas,I cleaned the data and then subset the data to only information I needed which was the reviewText and
            the rating.
    * Step 3: I made a new column in the data and assigned each review a positive, negative rating depending on the rating  
            (num of stars on the review).
    * Step 4: Using Pandas, I was able to sample the reviews to obtain testing and training data. Moreover, I made sure there
            was an equal propotion of negative and positive reviews as in the original data, there were too many positive reviews.
    * Step 5: Using the python library, Scikit-learn, I used a bag of words vectorizer to encode the text data in a bag of      words matrix. This technique is also used in our bot.
    * Step 6: I used several machine learning models and tested the accuracy of the model on testdata. I, then, picked the model with best accuracy and then saved that model.
    * Step 7: We had to change the code in our main file main.py to now use this sentiment analysis model to make better predictions.

    ### How the model was used

    The model is use to classify user input as either positive and negative and if negative connotation is detected with the user input, then the model apologizes to the user. This was not possible with the previous iteration of the chat-bot.

* ###    Spelling Mistakes Handler
    Novia Fan and Rick Feng was tasked to implement spell check for all user input for better prediction for model.
    * Step 1: Tokenize all patterns into bag of words with porter stemmer
    * Step 2: Send bag of words into the model as input training data
    * Step 3: Create and train the Neural Network model so it recognizes spelling mistakes
    * Step 4: Both NN.py and process_data,py has to adopt with porter stemmer(lancaster stemmer was used before)
    * Step 5: Any word that is inputed by user can be recogized as long as its still similar in spelling.

    ### How the model was used

    The model is used to chekc spelling mistakes that user might make wjile inputing question for the bot to answer. If user input word that resemble a word within patterns. The model will predict with this information in mind.

## How to run

step_0: clone the repo.  
step_1: ensure you have Python 3.6+.  
step_2: pip install all the required libraries.  
step_3: Just run `main.py`. (the model is already uploaded so there will be no training necessary. To see how the model was trained, check `NN.py` and `process_data.py`)  
step_4: after running `main.py`, there will be a few tensorflow warnings followed by
"Hello! This is the chatbot. I am here to make your shopping experience at Sakura effortless! (type 'quit' to quit.) Let's chat:"  
This means the project is running and you can simply type the questions you have for the bot.

## Project Structure

bakerai has the following file structure:

 ---translate.py
 ---flickr.py
 ---process_data.py  
 ---NN.py  
 ---main.py     
 ---server.py   
 ---unit-testing.py     
 ---client.py       
 ---clientGUI.py        
 ---sentiment_analysis.py     
 ---sentiment_analysis.ipynb      
 ---intents.json        
    
We have four files which all have one specific purpose as asked by the requirements.

### `process_data.py`

This file contains code which helps process our 'intents.json' file into a numpy array where each word's frequency corresponds to a cell in multi-dimensional numpy array. This structure is called bag of words in machine learning.

### `NN.py`

This file is where the model is trained. after running process_data.py, run this file next.
We were smart enough so that the code checks first if there is already a model present within the file structure. If not, only then the code uses Tensorflow to train a new model from the bag of words input provided by process_data.py

### `main.py`

This is the file which handles interacting with the model. we have a start function which has a while loop so that the user can query the model repeatedly. In the start function, we use the 'convert_input_to_bow()' function from NN.py which converts user input to the bag of words structure (previously mentioned). Then we use the model imported from NN.py, and use TensorFlow's inbuilt 'predict' function. We feed it the output from 'convert_input_to_bow()' function and it uses the model to give us a reply from the 'bot'.
We then do some processing and return a random response from intents.json depending on what the model classified the input as.

### `intents.json`

This is the data which the model is trained on. The model uses the 'tags' and 'patterns' as input when training. Then the trained model is able to take in some text, compare it with the 'patterns' section of each tag and then try to classify the 'tag' depending on the input. Once we have a 'tag' we just return one of the strings from the 'responses' section of the corresponding tag.

### `server.py and client.py`

These files work intertwined with each other. server.py has a template to a server class, and when run as a main method, creates a server prepared to respond to queries with bot responses. 
client.py contains the class template for the client designed to connect to the opened server. After running the file as main and entering the corresponding address and port name, clients are able to begin sending messages to the server, and reciving responses from the bot on their local machine.

### `unit-testing.py`

This is the file where we insert test variables and examine wether this bot is fully functional or not. This file consist of three methods: testIntent, testResponses(), testDefault(). TestIntent method tests an extremely negative response is truly negative. TestResponse method ensure we can get desired responses for very typical questions. TestDefault method ensure we can get a default response when not discussing any subjects. Summary available in 'test-summary.txt'

### `clientGUI.py`

Client GUI is the class template for a client object. While it's only 1 window and frame, it's still seperated into it's own class to attempt to follow a MVC structure. It uses the functions to locally find our BakerAi model responses, and display them to users, along with their own messages typed in the window. This allows the user to use the program outside of a command line context. It's likely the best place to run the program now, if you want a GUI experience with the best model.

### `sentiment_analysis.py `

This file handles the attitude of the user input if the sentiment analysis model recognize it. The training data is cleaned using Pandas and then subset the data to only information is needed which was the reviewText and the rating. The model is trained, and it assignes each review a positive, negative rating depending on the rating. When user input is very likly to be negative, the bot will apologizes to the user.

### `translate.py `

This file handles any translation feature that the chatbot has. languageDeteaction method for identifying non English input. translateThis method to translate user input from target language into English so the bot can process and predict. translateTo method to translate the prdicted answer back to target language for user to view.

### `flickr.py `

This file handles any photos/images that will be displayed in broswer when user input a question to chatbot. Take the pattern of the question in(for example user input question related to cake) and search a image that is related to the pattern. Take the retuen JSON file and trun it into dictionary for better manipulation. Generate the coorect URL for a randomly selected image from the JSON file that got reture back fomr Flickr server and display the image/photo of the product in browser.

## Functions

- Customer service and support.
- Provide information about products and services to the customer.

## Functionality which could be extracted as an API:

* The most obvious features which could be used as an API is our model getting responses itself. In main.py, we already have our file set up such that with simple function calls, and the users text as input, you can get a reply from the model. You can already call the model in an API kind of way, so that's the first place where API calls could be useful

* For smaller parts of the model which could be extract, the sentiment analysis itself is a seperate model, which can easily be queried given a user input for if the user input is positive or negative in tone. This could be useful in a number of applications, more than just for our specific model.

* The response model itself (with default, spellchecking, and basic response features) can be extracted seperately and used seperately from the sentiment analysis model, enabling API callers to ignore intent in their responses if they want to avoid considering angry customers.

* The client and server architecture with respect to sockets could also be extracted to be used for API calls fairly easily. The object itself is a bit rough around the edges for this task, but with some small modifcations, could be modified to have connection, listen, and response calls to make it more flexible

* process_data.py is the last file I could see extracted as an API. Whereas right now, it's designed to process a specific file in a specific location, given a path or different file, it's resonable to assume that a different data file could be extracted, and new responses neural nets trained off of different data sets. It wouldn't require a lot of modification and would allow users to train their own AI provided they followed our format

## Implementation

Bakerai uses advanced Natural Langugage Processing Techniques and Machine Learning Models to tailor responses specially to your needs.

some libraries which were used:

- numpy, ntlk, tensorflow, tflearn, pickle

## Requirements Definition

The ChatBot Bakerai should be able to answer basic day to day questions about the bakery and should keep customers entertained while they are waiting for their purchases??.
The ChatBot should be setted as an online assistant, to give customer information about the bakery before they come, so they can decide whether or not they want to visit.
AND customers can also order from the chatbot (future implementation) when they are in store.

It should be able to answer questions like:

Where is the bakery?

What is the hours of the bakery?

What baked goods are offered?

What specific items cost?

Potential allergies?

## Sample Input Ideas.

- greetings
- ask about location
- ask about time
- ask about menu
- ask about allergy
- ask about gluten free
- ask to buy cookie
- ask to buy coffee with cookie
- ask about customize cake
- ask to buy a cupcake for taste test haha
- Ask to tell a joke
- cookie in japanese: クッキー
- bubble tea in spanish: Té de burbujas
- cake in chinese: 蛋糕

## Limitation

We designed the model to predict the probability of each word in the user input. However, allergy is a strange pattern. Normally, converstation people conduct will have both the word allergy and the item they are allgergic to. For example, "I am allergic to peanut." Therefore, our bot struggle to predict any user input with allergy. We tried to account for this problem by adding alot of pattern for allergy tag. However, the outcome is not very proisming.
